### <a id="getting-started"></a> 🏎 Getting Started

#### <a id="clone-deploy"></a> ⛴ Clone & Deploy with Github and Vercel

Create new Github repo with vercel and deploy it within minutes. Could not be easier as hitting some buttons. Shipping of private repos is possible.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frichard-unterberg%2Fnext-leaflet-starter-typescript)

Later: Check out your repo locally and run ```npm install``` or ```yarn``` in root

Follow Instructions for [Starting Up](#start-up)

#### <a id="manual-install"></a> ⚙️ Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/richard-unterberg/leaflet-nextjs-ts-starter
# then
npm install
# or
yarn
```

### <a id="start-up"></a> 🏍️ Start up

According the official [Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started):

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Building with type checking and linting

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Start build locally

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

### <a id="coming-up"></a> 📊 Upcoming (probably)

+ redesign zoom in / zoom out
+ atom components for map ui
+ fix error when setting new coordinates in hot reload "Map container is already initialized."
+ breakpoint hook synced with tailwind breakpoint which is usable in js
+ multiple map instances per page
  + not possible atm since we read the map instance directly from window object 🤫
+ add axios for fetching data
  + move simulated "endpoint" (Places) to public folder and convert to JSON

### <a id="disable-lint"></a> 🤯 How to remove those  linting rules?

You can adjust the settings mainly in ```eslint.json``` and ```tsconfig.json```.

I've been using them a lot on my dayjob so I can't be anymore without them.

See this nice javascript implementation - This repo is heavily inspired by this one:
